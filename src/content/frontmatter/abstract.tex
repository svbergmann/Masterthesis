The \gls{CLUBB} model plays a crucial role in simulating atmospheric phenomena.
It uses the sum of two \glspl{pdf} to represent a single grid layer.
This approach, while computationally efficient,
restricts the model's ability to capture the full spectrum of potential shapes encountered in real-world atmospheric data.

This thesis proposes an innovative extension to the \gls{CLUBB} model.
We introduce a third normal \gls{CLUBB} strategically positioned between the existing two,
significantly enhancing the model's representational flexibility.
This trinormal representation allows for a wider range of grid-layer shapes while maintaining computational tractability.

The core of this work lies in deriving the necessary mathematical transformations for incorporating the third normal \gls{pdf} seamlessly into the \gls{CLUBB} framework.
This thesis lists all formulas, inputs, and outputs associated with the extended model.
Additionally, it tries to describe certain asymptotic behavior of the trinormal pdf under various parameter settings.
