\chapter{Integration using SymPy}\label{ch:intsympy}

Throughout this thesis, symbolic manipulation plays a crucial role in verifying mathematical expressions, particularly integrals.
To achieve this, we rely on SymPy\autocite{10.7717/peerj-cs.103}, a powerful Python library for symbolic mathematics.
This chapter delves into the world of SymPy, showcasing its capabilities through a detailed example.

We begin by demonstrating the analytical approach to solving an integral.

Next, we will explore the numerical side of integration.
We are going to demonstrate how SymPy can be seamlessly integrated with numerical computing libraries to evaluate the integral for specific input values.
This combined approach allows us to not only verify our analytical solution but also gain valuable insights into the integral's behavior for different scenarios.

By following this step-by-step example, the reader will gain a solid understanding of how SymPy can be used, not only for this thesis.
