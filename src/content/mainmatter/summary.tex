\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:summary}

In this thesis we saw how adding a third normal distribution to the \gls{CLUBB} model
would improve the representation of certain shapes.
While it is not entirely clear at first why this is an actual improvement,
there are some plots describing certain behaviors in \cref{sec:motivation-to-add-a-third-normal-component}.
Once we saw the graphical advantages,
we then defined the actual goal of this thesis (\cref{sec:goal-of-this-thesis}),
which happens to be
proving that certain formulas used in the \gls{CLUBB} model still work
with certain transformation explained in \cref{sec:derivation-of-trinormal-closures-by-transformation-of-binormal-closures}.
