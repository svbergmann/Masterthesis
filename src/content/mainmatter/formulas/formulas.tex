\chapter{Formulas that define the shape of the pdf and moments in terms of pdf parameters}
\label{ch:formulas-that-define-the-shape-of-the-pdf-and-moments-in-terms-of-pdf-parameters}

This chapter lists all formulas which are derived from the binormal model to this model with an additional normal.
All formulas listed are either tested by using a \gls{cas}
and calculating the integrals analytically with ranges $-\infty$ to $\infty$ or
using the quadrature procedure with large enough ranges such that the error is (numerically) zero.
Those two procedures are explained in \cref{ch:integration-using-sympy}.
