\chapter{Formulas}\label{ch:formulas}

This chapter lists all formulas which are derived from the binormal model to this model with an additional Normal.
All formulas listed are either tested by using a \gls{cas} and calculating the integrals analytically with ranges $-\infty$ to $\infty$ or using the quadrature procedure with large enough ranges such that the error was (numerically) zero.
Those two procedures are explained in \cref{ch:intsympy}.
