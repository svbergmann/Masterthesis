\section{Goal of this thesis}\label{sec:goal-of-this-thesis}

The goal of this thesis is to verify closure for higher-order moments,
such as the third order moment $\wptwothlp$ and others like it.
This closure is achieved by expressing these higher-order moments
-- i.e. \cref{eq:wp4}, \cref{eq:wp2thlp_solved}, and \cref{eq:wpthlp2_solved} --
analytically in terms of readily calculable lower-order moments.
This analytic approach uses the relationships between moments within a normal distribution,
enabling efficient model updates during the time-stepping process.
