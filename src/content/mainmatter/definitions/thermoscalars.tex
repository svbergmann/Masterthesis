\section{Thermodynamic Scalars}\label{sec:thermoscalars}

We denote the thermodynamic scalars by $w$, $r_t$, and $\theta_l$, where $w$ is the upward wind, $r_t$ is the liquid water potential
temperature and $\theta_l$ is the liquid water potential temperature\autocite[p. 10]{larson2022clubbsilhs}.
Variables denoted by \gls{w_prime} are defined by $w - \overline{w}$ where $\overline{w}$ is the mean of $w$ over the whole pdf.
We define \gls{r_t_prime} and \gls{theta_l_prime} in the same way.
